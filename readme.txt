Base Type System

Project Overview
A solid type system is an essential tool in design. Many times establishing a strong system can be a struggle. Having to start fresh each time can be frustrating. Having a solid starting point for a project’s typographic use is an essential need for any studio or design team. The *Base Type System* is just that, a starting point. 

Project Use
The example typeface used in the *Base Type System* is Lato by Łukasz Dziedzic. The system is designed to be implemented in a project and provide a solid, even type application across the project. Keep in mind this system has been optimized for the Lato typeface. If other typefaces are substituted for Lato micro adjustments may need to be implemented to maintain the typographic rhythm.
